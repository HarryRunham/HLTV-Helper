# HLTV-Helper

HLTV is a popular website for accessing statistics relating to the professional Counter Strike: Global Offensive scene.

The initial aim of this project is to create a relatively simple Java project that upon being ran, opens the pages of a given player's top 10 highest rated matches. Once this objective has been reached, there is huge scope for extension.

I often enjoy watching strong performances from interesting players - the idea of this project comes from a desire to automate the process of trawling through stats pages.
